# Web3 Learning Paths

**Context:** this  outlines 3 (non-mutually exclusive) learning paths, that cater to different time investments developers curious about Flow/Web3 may have at their disposal: 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week. The goal of these learning paths is to provide the maximum amount of value for the minimum amount of time, to get you building on testnet as quickly as possible, without sacrificing basic foundational knowledge. 

Choose your time investment:
- [1 hour: “The Lunch break”](https://github.com/muttoni/web3-learning-paths/#1-hour-the-lunch-break)
- [1 day: “The Weekend Project”](https://github.com/muttoni/web3-learning-paths/#1-day-the-weekend-project)
- [1 week: “The Deep Dive”](https://github.com/muttoni/web3-learning-paths/#1-week-the-deep-dive)


# 1 hour: “The Lunch break”

This learning path is designed to be a fast track for developers curious about web3 and Flow. In 1 hour you will understand how Flow works, its novel approach to address Ethereum’s shortcomings, how to write Smart Contracts and create a bare bones web3 app that communicates with the Flow testnet blockchain.

    - **Goal**: understand how a fully functioning NFT Marketplace is built
    - Mission: get familiar with the code.
- 4-5hrs: Dive into the best contracts: https://github.com/muttoni/gold-star-contracts
    - **Goal:** understand how the pros write smart contracts, what patterns they use, so that you can build off of idiomatic best practices!
    - **Foundational Interfaces:** These contracts are so-called foundational because they are standard interfaces that any FT or NFT contract will implement. They introduce commonly seen resources such as Vaults, Collections as well as standard events.
        - [FungibleToken Interface](https://github.com/onflow/flow-ft/blob/master/contracts/FungibleToken.cdc) - Example implementations: [FlowToken](https://flow-view-source.com/mainnet/account/0x1654653399040a61/contract/FlowToken), [FUSD](https://github.com/onflow/fusd/blob/main/contracts/FUSD.cdc)
        - [NonFungibleToken Interface](https://github.com/onflow/flow-nft/blob/master/contracts/NonFungibleToken.cdc) - See below for implementations
    - **[Flow Core Contracts](https://github.com/onflow/flow-core-contracts):** The core smart contracts powering the Flow Blockchain.
    - **[USDC Contract](https://github.com/flow-usdc/flow-usdc):** An implementation of the CENTRE Fiat Token in Cadence, on the Flow Blockchain. Shows a good example of a `FiatToken`, which implements interfaces `FungibleToken`, `FiatTokenInterface`, and `OnChainMultiSig`.
    - **[NFT Storefront](https://github.com/onflow/nft-storefront/blob/main/contracts/NFTStorefront.cdc):** The NFT storefront is a general-purpose Cadence contract for trading NFTs on Flow. NFTStorefront uses modern Cadence [run-time type](https://github.com/onflow/nft-storefront) facilities to implement a marketplace that can take any currency in order to vend any token in a safe and secure way. This means that only one instance of the contract is needed (visit link for its address on Testnet and Mainnet), and its resources, transactions, and scripts can be used by any account to create any marketplace.
    - **[Chainmonsters](https://github.com/bsidegames/chainmonsters-smart-contracts):** Each [Chainmonsters](https://chainmonsters.com/) NFT represents a Chainmon, item or cosmetic from within the game. The NFTs are grouped into seasons which usually have some overarching theme, exclusive items and rewards. Multiple NFTs can be minted from the same reward and each receives a serial number that indicates where in the edition it was minted.
    - **[.find](https://github.com/findonflow/find/tree/main/contracts):** [Find](https://github.com/muttoni/gold-star-contracts/blob/main/find.xyz) is a name service for Flow. It has contracts showing how to implement Profiles, Donations, displaying user's various NFTs (although things will change in the near future with the NFT Metadata standard) as well as how the .find name service works from a Smart Contract level.
    - **[Versus](https://github.com/versus-flow/versus-contracts):** [Versus](https://versus.auction/) is a novel auction style NFT marketplace. Its contracts show good examples of implementing the NFT interface as well as how to setup an auction style marketplace.
