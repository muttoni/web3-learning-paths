# Web3 Learning Paths

**Context:** this  outlines 3 (non-mutually exclusive) learning paths, that cater to different time investments developers curious about Flow/Web3 may have at their disposal: 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week. The goal of these learning paths is to provide the maximum amount of value for the minimum amount of time, to get you building on testnet as quickly as possible, without sacrificing basic foundational knowledge.
